# Country Data API App :earth_africa::sunny:

### About The Project

All about APIs. This project was created during one of my course tasks with the main aim to display specific data about a country or city. 
On running the code you will be able to view the population, elevation and current temperature data of the city using information from [Rapid API](https://rapidapi.com/).

Then in Visual Studio Code (VS Code) use the clone repository function, paste the link and use copy from url to save the file to a local drive as shown below and open the file using VSCode:
            
![save file](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122186007/213154907-e698ff0a-d044-41ad-8a89-4aec0a08768b.png)


### Usage
To use this app you will need an API key from Rapid API . If you do not already have one you will need to sign up to Rapid API and get a api key. Instruction on how this can be done can be found [here](https://rapidapi.com/blog/api-glossary/api-key/).

Once you have a key insert the key in the code shown below and then run the code in VS Code.

Once run, using Node.js for example in VS Code, you will see an output as shown below in the console with current API data for Cape Town.
